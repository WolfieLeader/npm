 * Node.js cryptography kit (Crypto Node.js API).

 * - Uses Node's `crypto` module.
 * - Synchronous API (throwing) + safe wrappers that return `Result` (non-throwing).
 * - JSDoc comments with `Explain Like I'm Five` sections.
 *
 * #### Contains:
 * - Secret key creation from passphrase.
 * - Data encryption and decryption.
 * - Object encryption and decryption.
 * - Data hashing (digest).
 * - Password hashing and verification with time-safe comparison.
 * - Object serialization and deserialization (to/from JSON).
 * - Pattern matching to validate encrypted data format.
 *
 * ### üçº Explain Like I'm Five
 * It's like a toolkit that helps you keep your and your users' secrets safe when using Node.js.
