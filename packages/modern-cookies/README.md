## About 📖

`modern-cookies` is a lightweight and modern cookie utility designed for Express and Nest.js applications. It simplifies cookie management with a focus on security, ease of use, and compatibility with modern web standards.
It provides a set of functions to set, get, and delete cookies with minimal configuration, while ensuring best practices for security and performance.

## Features 🌟

- ✅ **Simple API** - Easy-to-use functions `setCookie`, `getCookie`, and `deleteCookie` for managing cookies.
- 🔨 **Reliable** - Built on top of the `cookie` package for robust cookie parsing and serialization, with security in mind.
- ⚙️ **Type-Safe & Cross-Compatible** – Fully written in TypeScript with native types. Works in both ESM and CommonJS runtimes.

## Installation 🔥

```bash
npm install modern-cookies
```

> 💡 Works with `npm`, `pnpm`, and `yarn`. You can use it in dev dependencies since it's typically used only for local HTTPS.
