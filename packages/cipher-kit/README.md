## About 📖

`cipher-kit` is a modern encryption toolkit designed to work seamlessly across **Web**, **Node.js**, **Deno**, and **Bun** environments.  
It provides a simple, secure, and dependency-free API for encrypting and decrypting data with **AES-GCM**, ensuring strong security, predictable behavior, and type safety.

## Features 🌟

- 🛡️ **AES-GCM Encryption** – Secure and authenticated encryption with built-in integrity checks.
- 🌐 **Cross-Platform** – Works in Web, Node.js, Deno, and Bun without code changes.
- 🚫 **Zero Dependencies** – Fully self-contained, no external libraries required.
- 🔒 **SHA-256 Key Derivation** – Derives strong encryption keys from passwords.
- 🧪 **Strict Validation & `Result<T>` Typing** – Unified return type with robust input validation.

## Installation 🔥

```bash
npm install cipher-kit
```

> 💡 Works with `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun`, and `deno`. You can use it in dev dependencies since it's typically used only for local HTTPS.
